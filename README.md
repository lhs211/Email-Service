The appropiate microservices have been realised for an e-mail service, implemented using Go. The implementation provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and works with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). As a simplification, none of the microservices save any data permanently in a file system or database.
